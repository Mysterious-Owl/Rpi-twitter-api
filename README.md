#### To see it working https://youtu.be/962BUCFqvDA
<br>
Here I used the twython library to use Twitter API, this library can be used to all the things mentioned in twitter API document. 
<br>
To register for twitter API, go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/
<br>
To generate the API id and token go to https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps
<br>
You can also run this code on windows, just remove the GPIO library and remove all the lines referring to GPIO library. 
<br>
You can also automate the lights of your house by replacing relay instead of LEDs and modify the code as required.
<br>
You can also make twitter bot which favourites tweets, retweet tweet, give notification on specific keyword in tweet etc. in python.
<br>
To install twython follow the steps given on twython website.
